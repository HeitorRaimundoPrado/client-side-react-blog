    <h2>What is this project</h2>
    <p>This is a basic react project just so that I can
        understand the basic functionality behind reactjs
        <br/>
        Basically what you can do in this website
        is to create a new blog post that is stored in the
        client, besides you can leave a comment in a certain post
        <br/>
        The form on Sing Up page is only doesn't do anything
        and is there only for aesthetic reasons
      </p>  
      <h1>Enjoy!!</h1>
    </>
  );
}

export default Home
